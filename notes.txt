TERMINOLOGY AND RESOURCES THAT COULD BE HELPFUL

DAO: Data Access Object. These classes act as middlemen between the Service classes and the Database.
These handle CRUD operations.

Service Classes: Classes that handle the business logic of an object. i.e. calculations.
These do not handle database operations and often defer to a DAO.
