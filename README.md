## Scarlett

I worked on a branch called "scarlett-main", where I added more functionality to the program (writing skeleton code for GymApp, child-classes and user classes). I added the SQL file schema as well.

I also fixed some bugs with DBConnection, and some of the DAOS. I pushed these to my branch as well. Then I merged them to the main branch.

My team communicated some bugs and stuff that happened while merging with Git (it freaked out for some reason), and me and Zack fixed those bugs.

I mainly fixed major bugs with the project, and did User classes (including child-classes).

I did my own research as well, and found out that you can create a batch file that sets up your database automatically!

# Challenges I faced were:

when I fixed one thing with lets just say the Membership class, a bug would appear in the MembershipDAO etc.

I used Stack Overflow to look into some of these issues, which were mainly some syntax and SQL errors. (mainly catch errors).

I also upgraded the maven package used originally for the latest Maven version for better compatibility.

With all of this fixed, I merged it onto main and Zack fixed the rest of the small errors and added some things to the SQL script.
